ToDo
API
- Bank of project names and descriptions

Front-End (MVP)
- Basic display with a "Generate" button; assigns a project at random to the user
- This project is shown on an alternate display that enables a user to:
    - see the project's name and description
    - generate a new project if the current one is unsuitable

Stack
- Using Next.js since it's what I've primarily been working in, however this project seems perfect for learning a new lang, lib or fwork
- For MVP, the API will be a local json object

Stretch Goals
- Make data more detailed for ability to filter beyond preferences
- Separate API into its own repo and display for public use
    -   Once this is done, use SWR to handle
