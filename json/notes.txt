Summary
-------
Generally, I plan in a tidy way. This usually means using my .gitignore file and ensuring that the the curtain remains fully drawn
between the world and my ramblings, however since I'm designing and creating an API that's for public consumption I figure that I 
can use this file almost as the living development of a README so that anyone can see the process that I (rightly or wrongly) go
through to get to the finish line.

JSON Object Design

Extras: Ancilliary pieces that either form the basis of or provide support for a given project

imageSite: {name: str; url: str}; 
exampleSite: {name: str, url: str};
